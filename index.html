    <h2>Notable Contributions to Mathematics by This Great Mathematician</h2>
    <p><b> 

        My name is Ashish. I’m the developer of this webpage.
If you look at my educational qualification, I’m a B.Sc. Maths graduate.

Okay, why am I telling you this?

Because I’m from the same department to which this great mathematician belonged.
And most importantly, my roots are from Bihar, though I’m currently settled in Chennai.

Now you might wonder—why am I telling you all this?

Here’s the reason:
When I was in my final year of B.Sc. Maths, I came to know about the legend Vashishtha Narayan Singh.
I used to often ask my professors, “Where is all this maths used? Especially the engineering mathematics you people are teaching us?”

One fine day, I was just sitting in my class, I opened my mobile, and that’s when I first came to know about Vashishtha Narayan Singh—
The man who cracked NASA’s mathematics code…

   i was so inspired by his story that i decided to create this tribute page for him. 
    </b></p>

    <b>Contributed to theory of relativity and functional analysis.

His work is considered to be way ahead of its time.

Inspired countless students from Bihar and all over India to pursue mathematics.</b>  
  
   <h2>Teaching Career</h2>
  <B>After Returning to India, Singh worked at the Indian Institute of Technology kanpur for eight months, then at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Reserch (TIFR) In Bombay for a short-term position. Later, he was appointed as a faculty meber at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in kolkata where he worked until his retirement in 2006. Singh was known for his unconventional teaching methods and his ability to inspire students with his passion for mathamatics. He was also know 
   for his dedication to his students, often going out of his way to help them understand complex concepts.
